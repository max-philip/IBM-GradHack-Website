export const EXAMPLE_1 = "Joe, Steven and Sandy turn one of IBM’s elevators into moving barista-made coffee. A mini cafe serving all IBM floors. They research the effects of free coffee on employee morale and productivity, and create a business case including a cost analysis and implementation plan. Their presentation is even supported with a paper prototype with Joe acting as the barista! Free coffee for employees!"
export const EXAMPLE_2 = "Cybersecurity training is such a bore for Harry, George,  Charlotte and Kate. So they take matters into their own hands and turn the training into  a video game. They work on the game’s design and create storyboards for how players will  progress through the game. They then code a prototype and present a live demo at the showcase."
export const EXAMPLE_3 = "David, Maria and Alex often have to travel overseas for their projects. They have realised that they don’t know the emergency numbers of the countries they’ve been visiting, and worry about not being prepared for the worst. So, they decide to make an app that automatically finds and shows emergency contacts (ambulance, fire brigade, police etc.) for the country they are currently in."
