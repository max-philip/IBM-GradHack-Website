          A beautiful little sunset. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Use what you see, don't plan it. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.
          We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.
          We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Zip. That easy. Little short strokes.
          Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Just use the old one inch brush. You can do anything your heart can imagine.
